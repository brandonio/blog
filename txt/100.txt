I had just finished an amazing game of Betrayal At House On The Hill with my roommates. My friend, Joey, messaged to let me know he was outside my apartment. I messaged to let him know I'd be down shortly.

I met Joey, his cousins, Brent and Matthew, and Shil at the entrance. I brought down the Gypsy's pasta containers from the previous night's second dinner, after forgetting to do so twice already. It was raining, so I had Joey throw it away. I wasn't sure if it should have been recycled or not since it was dirty and I recently read a post on Reddit that pizza boxes shouldn't be recycled because grease seeps into them. Then I realized that the sauce couldn't seep into the plastic. By that time, Joey had already "landfilled" the garbage. I felt bad, but I remembered a lady from Cal Memorial Stadium's custodial staff telling me that they sorted trash up here, as she sorted Cal Hacks'. I motioned everyone inside the building. Matthew said he'd only come upstairs for a little while, but I'm glad he lied.
