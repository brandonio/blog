I am a huge fan of running gags, especially ones that evolve. Naturally, I adopted many of them into my snaps. Over time, friends have too, and I now have a collection of screenshots of their snaps. Maybe one day I'll post a link to that album. For now, here's a list of my snapstory series.

404 (active):
This is the http error code for "not found." At 4:04, I snap a pic captioned, "Error: [ting] not found." I change [ting] every time, except for when [ting] is LA, Berkeley, or, unfortunately, sleep. I love tech, so I wanted to bring some tech jokes into my snaps.

310 (active):
This is the area code for the best city, the one I gladly call home, Los Angeles. When I'm back, I make sure to take a "3:10 in the 310" snap, marking my return. Funnily enough, my freshman dorm was room 310.

327 (active):
I call 3:27 my "birthday time," but it isn't the time I was born. Rather, it is the <i>day</i> I was born: March 27. I document each time I see the number in the wild, which is <i>almost</i>-alarmingly high. Surprisingly, I only know a few others familiar with the concept of a "birthday time.

schnitzel count (seasonal):
I spent most of summer '17 in Israel, so hummus and schnitzel became part of my daily diet. I kept a running count of how many schnitzels I ate with a snap of each one. I averaged Â½ a schnitz' per day.

#freeThePlants (seasonal):
When I was in NYC during summer '17, I noticed that all the greenery was boxed in. I couldn't stand for this savagery, so I documented the caged plants, and I even freed a few.

war is imminent (seasonal):
UC Berkeley has a lot of protests. Some of these got out of hand, so now we have hundreds of police when a protest nears. It looks like war is imminent, hence the snaps.

<div class="nolim">friends don't let friends go to sleep without brushing their teeth (rare):</div>
FDLFGTSWBTT stems from my passion for dental hygiene. I wake up friends to brush their teeth if they didn't already brush.

6IX (rare):
I am a <i>huge</i> Drake fan, so I make many references to his hometown, known as "The Six." This is another number that I see everywhere (look at the date this was written), but I don't snap it as often because some people think I'm satanic.

walk home with me (rare):
Berkeley isn't the safest city, as you may know, so I like to take snaps of myself walking home late at night, playing music and letting my friends know how terrified I am. I don't put these on my story because I don't want family members freaking out.

Thomas, go to sleep! (retired):
Thomas is often awake at ungodly hours. I used to snap me singing, "Thomas, go to sleep!" and zooming in and out of his face so he'd sleep. It's beyond me why this wasn't effective.

"Feedback" - Kanye (retired):
Thomas is often <i>asleep</i> at ungodly hours, as well. I used to blast "Feedback" by Kanye and zoom into him waking up. This, too, failed to fix his sleeping habits.
